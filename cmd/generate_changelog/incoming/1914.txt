### PR [#1914](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1914) by [majiayu000](https://github.com/majiayu000): feat(code_helper): add stdin support for piping file lists

- Added stdin support for piping file lists to code_helper, enabling commands like `find . -name '*.go' | code_helper "instructions"` and `git ls-files '*.py' | code_helper "Add type hints"`
- Implemented automatic detection of stdin pipe mode with single argument (instructions) support
- Enhanced tool to read file paths from stdin line by line while maintaining backward compatibility with existing directory scanning functionality
