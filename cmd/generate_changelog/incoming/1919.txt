### PR [#1919](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1919) by [ksylvan](https://github.com/ksylvan): Fix the `last_pr_sync` setting during PR incoming processing

- Fix: update `SetLastPRSync` to use version date instead of current time
- Change last_pr_sync to use versionDate instead of time.Now()
- Ensure future runs fetch PRs merged after the version date
- Add clarifying comments explaining the sync timing logic
