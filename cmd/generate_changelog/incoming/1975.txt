### PR [#1975](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1975) by [koriyoshi2041](https://github.com/koriyoshi2041): feat: add suggest_clawdbot_command pattern for Clawdbot CLI

- Feat: add suggest_clawdbot_command pattern
Add a new pattern for suggesting Clawdbot CLI commands based on
natural language intent. Clawdbot is an open-source AI agent framework
(github.com/moltbot/moltbot) that connects LLMs to messaging
platforms, devices, and developer tools.
This follows the same structure as suggest_gt_command: command
reference tables, intent mapping, and a pipe-friendly output format
where the first line is the executable command.
All commands verified against clawdbot help and subcommand --help
output (v2026.1.23).
