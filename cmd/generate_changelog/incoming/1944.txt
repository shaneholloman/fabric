### PR [#1944](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1944) by [ksylvan](https://github.com/ksylvan): Add Infermatic AI Provider Support

- Add Infermatic provider to ProviderMap as part of Phase 1 implementation for issue #1033
- Add test coverage for the Infermatic AI provider in TestCreateClient to verify provider exists and creates valid client
- Replace go-git status API with native `git status --porcelain` command to fix worktree compatibility issues
- Simplify `IsWorkingDirectoryClean` and `GetStatusDetails` functions to use CLI output parsing instead of go-git library
- Use native `git rev-parse HEAD` to get commit hash after commit and remove unused imports from walker.go
