### PR [#1981](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1981) by [infinitelyloopy-bt](https://github.com/infinitelyloopy-bt): fix(azure): support GPT-5 and o-series reasoning models

- Fix Azure OpenAI integration to support GPT-5 and o-series reasoning models
- Update default API version from 2024-05-01-preview to 2025-04-01-preview (required for o-series and GPT-5 models)
- Remove NeedsRawMode override that always returned false, inheriting parent logic that correctly skips temperature/top_p for reasoning models
- Add /responses route to deployment middleware for future v1 API support
- Style: remove trailing blank line in azure.go to fix gofmt check
