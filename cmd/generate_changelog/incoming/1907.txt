### PR [#1907](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1907) by [majiayu000](https://github.com/majiayu000): feat(gui): add Session ID support for multi-turn conversations

- Add Session ID support for multi-turn conversations with session name parameter to GUI chat interface, enabling persistent multi-turn conversations similar to CLI's --session flag
- Fix Session ID input and improve layout by removing reactive statement that was resetting input on each keystroke and changing layout to stack input and dropdown vertically
- Extract SessionSelector component and address PR feedback by creating dedicated SessionSelector.svelte component and using Select component instead of native select
- Fix Select binding and empty input handling with proper two-way binding and handling empty input to clear session when user clears the field
- Add session message loading when selecting existing session with proper error handling and simplified reactive statements using nullish coalescing
