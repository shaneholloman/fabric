### PR [#1999](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1999) by [ghrom](https://github.com/ghrom): feat: add 3 patterns from cross-model AI dialogue research

- Add `audit_consent` pattern for detecting manufactured consent via power asymmetry analysis, surfaced from a devil's advocate "consent theater" critique across multi-model stress testing.
- Add `detect_silent_victims` pattern to identify harmed parties who cannot speak for themselves, including future generations and unaware victims.
- Add `audit_transparency` pattern for evaluating whether decisions are explainable to affected parties across five dimensions.
- Register all three new patterns in pattern descriptions and extracts JSON files, and categorize them under ANALYSIS and CR THINKING in `suggest_pattern`.
- Update `pattern_explanations.md` with renumbered entries to reflect the newly added patterns.
