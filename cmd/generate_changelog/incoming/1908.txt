### PR [#1908](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1908) by [rodaddy](https://github.com/rodaddy): feat(ai): add VertexAI provider for Claude models

- Added support for Google Cloud Vertex AI as a provider to access Claude models using Application Default Credentials (ADC)
- Enabled routing of Fabric requests through Google Cloud Platform instead of directly to Anthropic for GCP billing
- Implemented support for Claude models (Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5, Haiku 4.5, etc.) via Vertex AI
- Added Google ADC authentication support eliminating the need for API keys
- Configured project ID and region settings with 'global' as default for cost optimization
