# Release Notes

### PR by [ghrom](https://github.com/ghrom): feat: add 3 patterns from cross-model AI dialogue research

- Add `audit_consent` pattern for detecting manufactured consent through power asymmetry analysis
- Add `detect_silent_victims` pattern for identifying parties harmed but unable to speak up (future, voiceless, unaware, diffuse, structural)
- Add `audit_transparency` pattern for evaluating whether decisions are explainable to affected parties
