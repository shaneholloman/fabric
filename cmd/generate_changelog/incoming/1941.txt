### PR [#1941](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1941) by [ksylvan](https://github.com/ksylvan): Add `greybeard_secure_prompt_engineer` to metadata, also remove duplicate json data file

- Add greybeard_secure_prompt_engineer pattern to metadata (pattern explanations and json index)
- Refactor build process to use npm hooks for copying JSON files instead of manual copying
- Update .gitignore to exclude generated data and tmp directories
- Modify suggest_pattern categories to include new security pattern
- Delete redundant web static data file and rely on build hooks
