### PR [#1965](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1965) by [infinitelyloopy-bt](https://github.com/infinitelyloopy-bt): fix(azure): Fix deployment URL path for Azure OpenAI API

- Fixed deployment URL path construction for Azure OpenAI API to correctly include deployment names in request URLs
- Added custom middleware to transform API paths and extract deployment names from request body model fields
- Moved StreamOptions configuration to only apply to streaming requests, as Azure rejects stream_options for non-streaming requests
- Added Azure OpenAI troubleshooting documentation with technical details and configuration guidance
- Resolved SDK route matching bug that was preventing proper URL generation for Azure OpenAI endpoints
