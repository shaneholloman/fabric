'$100M Offers' teaches business owners how to create offers that sell while charging premium prices.

Alex Hormozi is an accomplished entrepreneur, philanthropist, and investor with over $100 million of net worth. He draws from his own extensive experience, having successfully scaled and exited numerous companies, authored best-selling books, and amassed nearly two million subscribers on his YouTube channel

From the start I was immediately drawn to him as his approach is always practical. He shares actionable tips to drive a positive change. By the way, Hormozi doesn't promise a $100 million windfall from this book or course. This figure actually symbolizes the cumulative result of a select few "Grand Slam Offers" strategically employed across his own diverse business ventures. “Grand Slam Offers” are offers so irresistible that clients can't say no.

So what makes a Grand Slam Offer or an Irresistible Offer, according to Hormozi? Let’s get into the formula !

## I. Offer the Incomparable or referred to as a “Category of One.”

To sell more of anything, turn your product or service into a distinctive, one-of-a-kind offer. Create a situation where customers cannot directly compare your offering to competitors, mitigating the tendency for price comparisons. This approach facilitates smoother sales and enables you to command higher prices. Many businesses still compete on price, which will invariably lead to diminishing profits. By commoditizing their offerings, they inadvertently make it simple for customers to switch to competitors offering lower prices.

Hormozi provides solutions to address "the commodity problem" :

1\. Identify a Starving Crowd: The foundation of a business is not just the product or service but the target market. Start by aligning with a group of individuals driven by urgent needs, desires, or pain points, he advises.

They :

Should Possess a Massive Pain: Prospects should possess a compelling need for your offer.

Have Purchasing Power: Prospects must have the financial means to make the purchase.

Are Easy to Target: Your audience should belong to easily reachable markets. Are Growing: Opt for markets that are expanding to facilitate faster progress.

2\. Specialize Your Niche: Opting for a smaller customer target group typically accelerates the success of a startup. Focusing on a narrower segment makes a company "automatically" an authority in that space, enhancing the sales message's effectiveness. Hormozi recommends expanding the customer profile only after reaching a revenue milestone, such as making $10 million annually.

3\. Craft a Distinctive Offer: Enhance your product or service by incorporating additional elements, ensuring that your overall offering comprehensively addresses customer problems, surpassing anything else available in the market.

## II. Enhance the Perceived Value of Your Product

To command higher prices, elevate your product's desirability, certainty, speed, and user-friendliness. According to Hormozi, opting for higher prices is typically a strategic move, contrasting with businesses competing on low prices, which puts them in a detrimental cycle of diminishing profits, compromised product quality, and dissatisfied customers.

In contrast, businesses charging premium prices tend to experience an upward trajectory. The higher profit margins allow them to invest more in product quality and customer experience. Hormozi's clients, emotionally connected to the premium experience, demonstrate higher levels of engagement, resulting in more decisive actions and superior outcomes. Additionally, psychological studies indicate that individuals perceive more expensive products as superior, similar to paying more for wine, which somehow makes it taste better to our brains. But by increasing prices, won’t we scare away customers? No, as long as we increase our product’s perceived value; that way customers will still feel they are getting a great deal.

Here are four ways to raise our product’s value:

Connect with customers' authentic desires. These desires tend to be rooted in universal human needs such as shelter, food, belonging, love, and appreciation. The stronger the desire, the greater their willingness to pay.

Emphasize Benefits Over Features: Differentiate between features and benefits, concentrating on communicating how your product or service delivers tangible results rather than listing its features. This is a classic in the tech industry, and I lived through the transformation some 10-15 years ago.

Here are examples:

Slack:

* Feature-focused: An instant messaging app allowing teams to communicate via text, video, and audio huddles.
* Benefit-focused: It's faster than email, and messages are better organized. It gives teams a more efficient and productive way to stay in sync.

An eCommerce Site:

* Feature-focused: Secure and encrypted Transactions
* Benefit-focused: Boost Customer Trust and Increase Sales

Provide Certainty: People tend to avoid risk, appreciate certainty, and are willing to pay more for a perceived higher likelihood of achieving the desired result. This explains why services offering a "done-for-you" solution can command a premium. And where possible, offer guarantees.

Expedite Results: People value speed and will pay more to get their desire or get out of pain faster. With less Effort: Make it easier for customers to get their desired results. Make it simple, remove unnecessary steps, undertake the work on their behalf, or provide tools that facilitate their journey.

## III. Solve All Their Problems

Hormozi suggests developing an offer that eliminates ALL barriers between your customer and their ultimate desire. The key to creating truly exceptional "Grand Slam Offers" is crafting a unique proposition that resonates deeply with your customers. The summary of Hormozi's teachings can be broken down into these three essential steps:

Identify the customer’s real desire by repeatedly asking "why" until you reach their core motivation. Your new offer should be constructed around this underlying drive. We need to look beyond what our competition offers in the market today and create something that more closely matches the customer’s needs.

List EVERY hurdle to their desire: Identify the problems, setbacks, and challenges customers may encounter on their journey to their desired goal. Your offer should present solutions to ALL these obstacles.

Propose individual solutions for each obstacle: Develop offerings that address each problem identified in the previous step. These solutions will be bundled together to form your exceptional offer. In the initial brainstorming phase, generate a multitude of ideas without concern for implementation difficulties, as feasibility can be addressed later.

## IV. Stack Your Offer

The perceived value of your offer can be elevated through exciting names, bonuses, strategic stacking, and guarantees. This is the stage where the findings from customer research and the creative brainstorming of previous steps come together, resulting in a polished offer that potential customers will find irresistible. Here is a quick overview of the process:

Naming. Give exciting names to your overall offer (and each individual component within your offer) and focus on the result the customers want to achieve. Good names can also include WHO it’s for, HOW LONG it will take, and WHY a current promotion is happening. For example, "Double Your Organic Traffic in 2 Months."

Bonuses. Break down your offer into multiple components to increase the overall perceived value. This approach enables you to showcase and sell each element separately, increasing the perceived value of the bundled offer.

Stacking. Create a comprehensive list of every component in your offer, assigning each a separate value. Sum up the individual values to illustrate that the price of your offer is significantly less than its total value.

Guarantees: Mitigate the perceived risk for customers by offering guarantees. According to Alex Hormozi, providing a guarantee is the "number one way" to boost sales.

## V. Make it Limited

Skyrocket demand for your offer by using the psychology of scarcity, urgency, and exclusivity. There are other ways to increase demand for our offer that don’t require lowering the price. Researchers have studied human behavior for decades, and some clear psychological factors can influence our purchasing decisions.

Here are 3 of them:

Scarcity. Restricting the quantity. According to Hormozi, the most effective scarcity is honesty; for instance, businesses can openly limit the number of clients they serve.

Urgency. Incorporating deadlines and limited-time promotions motivates people to buy now rather than delay their purchase. This is really scarcity applied to time. The promotion could be a discount sale or a limited-time bonus.

Exclusivity. People will pay more if it increases their status. Hormozi employs a strategy he terms "skimming the pyramid" in his service-oriented business, preferring to sell services to two clients at $5,000 each rather than 20 clients at $500. Not only is it easier to serve two clients well, it also creates pent-up demand the next time the doors open for the offer.
